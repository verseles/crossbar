# Configuration for dart test runner

  hardware:
    # Tests that interact with real hardware (audio, screen, wifi, bluetooth)
    # These tests modify system state and may cause glitches when run locally.
    # 
    # To skip hardware tests locally:
    #   flutter test --exclude-tags=hardware
    #
    # CI runs all tests, but hardware commands may fail gracefully
    # since containers don't have real hardware.
